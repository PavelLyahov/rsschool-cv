### About me:

I am a quality assurance engineer with more than 2 years of practical experience. I have worked with different technologies, but in the role of QA automation mostly with Selenium and Java.<br>

I also served as a technical coordinator of projects, where I was engaged in the implementation of technologies that facilitate the testing process and improve the quality of projects.<br>

For a while I was a mentor at a course on test automation.<br>

In my free time, I study web development technologies on my own, for a better understanding of web applications and the causes of bugs.
